# Graph Element Networks
Code for the [paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/alet19a.html) Graph Element Networks: adaptive, structured computation and memory. See [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09019) for the arxiv link.

You can see the talk summarizing the paper [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp9CjkOQm48).
## Code for the scene representation experiments
You can find the self-contained code for the scene representation experiments in the [scene_representation folder](https://github.com/FerranAlet/graph_element_networks/tree/master/scene_representation) folder and the Graph Element Network code in the [composer](https://github.com/FerranAlet/graph_element_networks/blob/master/scene_representation/GEN/composer.py) and the representation function [here](https://github.com/FerranAlet/graph_element_networks/blob/master/scene_representation/GEN/structure.py#L63).
